## Learn about workflows

* Creating, Editing and Importing Galaxy Workflows at https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/workflow-editor/tutorial.html
* Extracting Workflows from Histories at https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/history-to-workflow/tutorial.html
* Automating Galaxy workflows using the command line at https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/workflow-automation/tutorial.html
* Using Workflow Parameters at https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/workflow-parameters/tutorial.html
* Workflow Reports at https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/workflow-reports/tutorial.html

## Get a workflow

* Make one using the workflow canvas
* Create one from an existing Galaxy history
* Import one from a GTN tutorial or from **Shared Data: Workflows**

## Test it with a small data set

* The smaller, the better! 
* Subsample large data sets if possible. 

## View outputs

* The outputs appear in your history - but they populate according to when the jobs are scheduled, rather than the end points of the workflow. 
* To see a more natural order of the outputs, go to **User: Workflow Invocations** to see the list of workflows you have run. 
* Click on the workflow of interest to expand. 
* Click on "Steps" to expand.
* In each step, click on "Output datasets", and view with the eye icon. 

## Tag outputs

* In the workflow canvas, click on a tool and see the parameters in the right-hand panel. 
* Click on "Configure output". You can re-name the output file, and/or add tags. 
* For example, to easily find an output assembly, you could tag it with #final-assembly.
